  <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
  <p>A superhero is a person who does beroie deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero, <strong> yuo need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,  </strong> and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.</p>
  <p>For instance, a good guy fighting u bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it's a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a ormal human being couldn't do, couldn't accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhem. </p>
